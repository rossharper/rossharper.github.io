&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: yes, you can!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;overview&quot;&gt;Overview&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our team, we use a Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach when writing code. I’m a supporter of this approach and its many benefits. I won’t go into the benefits here — you can &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=test%20driven%20development&quot; title=&quot;Search Google for test driven development&quot;&gt;Google many articles on the subject&lt;/a&gt; (other search providers are available).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://scratch.mit.edu&quot; title=&quot;Scratch website&quot;&gt;Scratch&lt;/a&gt;, from MIT, is essentially a visual programming environment that &lt;em&gt;“helps young people learn to think creatively, reason systematically, and work collaboratively — essential skills for life in the 21st century”&lt;/em&gt;. There’s a growing movement around teaching kids to code, that will hopefully play an important part in solving the skills and diversity shortages our industry has.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One day, the crazy thought popped into my head: &lt;em&gt;“Can you TDD in Scratch?”&lt;/em&gt;. I did a brief Google, and couldn’t find any examples of TDD in Scratch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, in my “10% time”, I looked into doing some TDD in Scratch. For my first experiment, I implemented the algorithm for the &lt;a href=&quot;http://codingdojo.org/kata/RomanNumerals/&quot; title=&quot;Description of the Roman Numerals Kata on CodingDojo&quot;&gt;Roman Numerals Kata&lt;/a&gt;. I cheated a little here, by implementing the algorithm first and then put a test around it afterward (this &lt;em&gt;isn’t&lt;/em&gt; TDD!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This at least proved that it is possible to separate my algorithm logic and have tests around it. So next I decided to do some actual TDD in Scratch…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This weekend I’ve been learning a little &lt;em&gt;Kotlin&lt;/em&gt; — the &lt;a href=&quot;https://kotlinlang.org/&quot; title=&quot;Kotlin websire&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;(relatively) new JVM language from JetBrains&lt;/a&gt;. Once I’d worked my through the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://kotlinlang.org/docs/tutorials/koans.html&quot; title=&quot;Kotlin Koans&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;“Koans”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, I decided to try a simple &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kata_(programming)&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Code Kata&lt;/a&gt;. I chose the &lt;a href=&quot;http://codingdojo.org/cgi-bin/index.pl?KataRomanNumerals&quot; title=&quot;Roman Numerals Kata description on CodingDojo&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Roman Numerals Kata&lt;/a&gt; for this exercise. Whilst doing this, I wanted to use a parameterised unit test, and had to figure out how to do that in Kotlin… &lt;!--more--&gt; I wont go into the details of the Kata (read the link if you are interested), but in a nutshell, the goal is to write a program that will convert the Arabic numerals we are accustomed to in the modern world to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.novaroma.org/via_romana/numbers.html&quot; title=&quot;A description of Roman numeral representation&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;the representation used by the ancient Romans&lt;/a&gt;. For example, you may have noticed Roman Numerals used to denote the year a movie was released: 1977 becomes “MCMLXXVII”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I set out on the exercise using &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;TDD&lt;/a&gt;, I got to the point where I had two similar unit tests:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script src=&quot;https://gist.github.com/rossharper/5c8fe130cac356075912.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point we can see that there is some duplication in the tests. The rest of the tests will follow a similar pattern. Therefore, I wanted to refactor the tests to become &lt;em&gt;parameterised&lt;/em&gt; tests — this is what I’d usually do when writing a Java JUnit4 test, after all. In Java, this involves:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;indicating that the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Parameterized&lt;/code&gt; test runner should be used&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;adding a static method — denoted by the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;@Parameters&lt;/code&gt; annotation — that that will provide the collection of test cases containing an array of parameters for each test&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;add a constructor to the test class that will receive the parameters for each test case&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It may look a little like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script src=&quot;https://gist.github.com/rossharper/6b5a9a414edb00cd12a6.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(obviously, we’d use better variable names than &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;paramOne&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;paramTwo&lt;/code&gt; when doing this for real, I’ve used these here for clarity)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Creating a parameterised test in Kotlin is a little different than in Java. The main reason being that &lt;a href=&quot;https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/classes.html#companion-objects&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Kotlin does not have static member functions on classes&lt;/a&gt;. However, we can add compatibility for calling Java code, by putting our function in a &lt;em&gt;“companion object”&lt;/em&gt;, and annotating it with the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;@JvmStatic&lt;/code&gt; annotation (&lt;a href=&quot;https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/java-to-kotlin-interop.html#static-methods&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Kotlin Reference&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script src=&quot;https://gist.github.com/rossharper/cb3e183d0fbaf2e25b10.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, we can create a parameterised Kotlin unit test like so:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script src=&quot;https://gist.github.com/rossharper/8f6c3c169b6b5c23e12c.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;tldr&quot;&gt;TL;DR&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To create a parameterised unit test in Kotlin:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;annotate the Kotlin test class with &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;@RunWith(Parameterized::class)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;place the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;@Parameterized.Parameters&lt;/code&gt; function within a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;companion object&lt;/code&gt; in the test class&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;annotate the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;@Parameterized.@Parameters&lt;/code&gt; function with the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;@JvmStatic&lt;/code&gt; annotation — as Kotlin doesn’t have static functions, this allows Java code to call this Kotlin as if it were a static&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Use Kotlin’s &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Any&lt;/code&gt; in place of Java’s &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Object&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;background&quot;&gt;Background&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had been looking to start tinkering with my Raspberry Pi and do some home automation for a while. We have a Siemens RCR10/433 wireless thermostat programmer that controls our boiler and I wondered if it would be possible to hack the radio signal and take control of the boiler myself. Thus, I could create my own smart heating system inspired by products such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://nest.com/uk/&quot; title=&quot;Nest website&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Nest&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hivehome.com&quot; title=&quot;Hive website&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Hive&lt;/a&gt;. This post roughly outlines the process I used to sniff the signals sent between the thermostat and the receiver relay that controls the physical call for heat signal to the boiler. &lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;research&quot;&gt;Research&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A quick Google search and I’d found some other people that had tried to do a similar thing with their boilers. First up, Steven Hale, who had a couple of great posts about &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.stevenhale.co.uk/main/2013/08/home-automation-reverse-engineering-a-worcester-bosch-dt10rf-wireless-thermostat/&quot; title=&quot;Steven Hale's article on reverse engineering a Worcester-Bosch DT10RF wireless thermostat&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Reverse Engineering a Worcester-Bosch DT10RF wireless thermostat&lt;/a&gt; in which he sniffs his thermostat’s signals and a further post with the detail of how he built a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.stevenhale.co.uk/main/2013/07/making-a-soundcard-logic-analyser/&quot; title=&quot;Steven Hale's article on building a Soundcard Logic Analyser&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Soundcard Logic Analyser&lt;/a&gt; to do the sniffing. Secondly, I found a similar post (&lt;a href=&quot;https://damn.technology/controlling-british-gas-wr1-receiver-arduino&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;https://damn.technology/controlling-british-gas-wr1-receiver-arduino&lt;/a&gt;) detailing the same method of sniffing the thermostat’s radio signal. I identified that my thermostat uses the same radio frequency as those in the above posts: 433MHz (the clue is in the product name!). Perfect, I had something to go on. 433MHz transmitter and receiver ordered….  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;sniffing-the-signals&quot;&gt;Sniffing the Signals&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rossharper.net/img/wp-imports/2015/11/Photo-30-03-2015-17-14-14.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.rossharper.net/img/wp-imports/2015/11/Photo-30-03-2015-17-14-14.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;433MHz transmitter and receiver&quot; title=&quot;433MHz transmitter and receiver&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter wp-image-551&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;600&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once I had my 433MHz transmitter and receiver, I wired them up using a prototyping breadboard to my Raspberry Pi in a vain attempt to simply read the signals straight out of the air. The plan was to listen to the signal on the receiver’s data port whilst operating the thermostat to trigger its signals. No luck. The software I was using on the Raspberry Pi did not produce any results. Presumably the encoding used by my thermostat is non-standard. (I don’t remember the software off the top of my head. RC Switch, perhaps?)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, the easy approach didn’t work — it was time to follow the posts mentioned above and build the ghetto-style logic analyser.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this, I needed to buy the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a length of shielded stereo cable (I tried with some old earphone cable at first but it was too thin)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a 3.5mm stereo jack&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;some 18k resistors&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;some 82k resistors (I already had some wires, solder, and a soldering iron).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn’t go to the extent that Steven Hale did, I just wired up one channel, and didn’t bother with shrink wrap to make it look professional. This is probably a one-off tool for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rossharper.net/img/wp-imports/2015/11/Photo-02-04-2015-19-29-42-e1448313674238.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.rossharper.net/img/wp-imports/2015/11/Photo-02-04-2015-19-29-42-e1448313674238.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Ghetto Logic Analyser&quot; title=&quot;Ghetto Logic Analyser&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter wp-image-539&quot; width=&quot;450&quot; height=&quot;600&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Arranged the receiver on the breadboard, powered by Raspberry Pi power via its header pins&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Connected the logic analyser probes to the GND and DATA pins of the receiver via the breadboard&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Plugged the stereo jack into my Mac’s line-in/mic port&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fired up Audacity and hit record&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Operated the thermostat to cause it to send signals&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once I’d recorded some signals, I found them amongst the noise, and zoomed in to see them. But something was wrong…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rossharper.net/img/wp-imports/2015/11/Photo-02-04-2015-19-30-28.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.rossharper.net/img/wp-imports/2015/11/Photo-02-04-2015-19-30-28.png&quot; alt=&quot;First signal&quot; title=&quot;First signal&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter wp-image-542&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;375&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This wasn’t the clear, decipherable, square-wave I was expecting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I looked at the levels, it was clear that I was only getting a very faint signal. I guessed it must be something to do with the line level on the Mac, and that the resistance of my analyser was pulling the signal too low. So I experimented…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I modified the analyser to add a second 18k resistor on the unused lead. This time in series, rather than across the data and ground leads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rossharper.net/img/wp-imports/2015/11/Photo-23-11-2015-21-11-04-e1448313787989.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.rossharper.net/img/wp-imports/2015/11/Photo-23-11-2015-21-11-04-e1448313787989.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Ghetto Logic Analyser V2&quot; title=&quot;Ghetto Logic Analyser V2&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter wp-image-543&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;450&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(&lt;strong&gt;NOTE&lt;/strong&gt;: I was probably taking a bit of a risk here, that my soundcard might have been damaged by the higher voltages. But I figured “it’s 5V from a Raspberry Pi — what’s the worst that can happen?”. If you are following me, &lt;strong&gt;proceed with caution&lt;/strong&gt; — I am no electronics engineer!)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bingo. I had a signal. It appeared to be upside-down, so I flipped it in Audacity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is the boiler ON signal when the noise either side is removed:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rossharper.net/img/wp-imports/2015/11/Screen-Shot-2015-11-23-at-21.16.08.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.rossharper.net/img/wp-imports/2015/11/Screen-Shot-2015-11-23-at-21.16.08.png&quot; alt=&quot;Tranmission received&quot; title=&quot;Tranmission received&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter wp-image-544&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;368&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- markdownlint-disable MD036 --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(I later flipped HIGH/LOW back in my program, I just found the signal easier to read this way round)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There appear to be a number of packets. Zooming in to an individual packet, we can see the individual HIGH/LOW signals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rossharper.net/img/wp-imports/2015/11/Screen-Shot-2015-11-23-at-21.26.04.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.rossharper.net/img/wp-imports/2015/11/Screen-Shot-2015-11-23-at-21.26.04.png&quot; alt=&quot;Zoomed in view of a packet&quot; title=&quot;Zoomed in view of a packet&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter wp-image-546&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;368&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The signal is pulled LOW for a period before the packet begins. There are also two different lengths of pulse: one must represent a binary ‘1’ and the other a ‘0’. I &lt;em&gt;guessed&lt;/em&gt; that a long pulse would be a ‘1’ and the short pulse a ‘0’. Then I got to work reading all the individual 1s and 0s in the packets. I discovered that the packets were repeating and that for the ON signal there were just two packets:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-none&quot;&gt;    100001000101111010000000100000001
    111110111010000101111111011111110
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;there are 33 bits per packet&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the first bit is always ‘1’, which must be a “start bit” that indicates the beginning of a packet&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the following 32 bits comprise the message&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the second packet is the opposite (bitwise NOT) of the first packet (excluding the start bit) I repeated the above for the OFF signal from the thermostat. These were the packets:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-none&quot;&gt;    100001000101111010000000100000000
    111110111010000101111111011111111
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we can see that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the first 31 bits of the packet (excluding the start bit again) are the &lt;em&gt;same&lt;/em&gt; in both the ON and OFF signals — this must be some sort of ID* — &lt;strong&gt;Update&lt;/strong&gt;: it appears these aren’t always the same for all units – &lt;a href=&quot;#update--30th-march-2016&quot;&gt;see below&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The final bit in the first packet indicates ON or OFF. 1 in the ON signal, 0 in the OFF signal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;( * the ID is either hardcoded into the thermostat and learned by the receiver during pairing, or it is created and shared during pairing. I hope it is the former, as it would be a pain to have to keep sniffing a signal again if the receiver ever loses contact with the transmitter! I haven’t tested this yet.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that I had the packet contents, there was one more thing left to determine: the timings of the pulses and the gaps between them. Using Audacity, I measured (in nanoseconds) the length of:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the initial delay between the transmitter putting out a signal (HIGH), to beginning the first packet — this was measured from when the random noise stopped to when the signal was first pulled LOW&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the delay before the packet starts (from when it was pulled LOW to indicate a packet is coming, and when it goes HIGH for the first bit)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a long pulse&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a short pulse&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the pause between pulses&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the delay between packets&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of these are constant values, except the delay between packets which appears to be random. However, I just recorded each of these and will replay the same values each time in my boiler control program. If you are following this yourself in order to hack an RCR10, &lt;del datetime=&quot;2016-03-30T18:17:44+00:00&quot;&gt;you probably don’t need to measure the lengths. You probably just need to decode the packets and plug the 1s and 0s into my boilercontrol program&lt;/del&gt;(see &lt;a href=&quot;#update--30th-march-2016&quot;&gt;Update&lt;/a&gt;, below).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;replaying-the-signals--boiler-control-program&quot;&gt;Replaying the Signals — Boiler Control Program&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that I had sniffed the signals, it was time to see if I could replay them through my 433MHz transmitter, connected to my Raspberry Pi, to turn my boiler on and off. So, I created my &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rossharper/boilercontrol&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;“boilercontrol” program&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s written in C++, based on stuff I’d read on various blogs and websites that I don’t remember, and uses the &lt;a href=&quot;http://wiringpi.com/&quot; title=&quot;WiringPi website&quot;&gt;WiringPi&lt;/a&gt; library to control the pins on the Raspberry Pi in order to send data to the transmitter. It’s written in C++ for two reasons:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;it compiles to native code that should mean it is more likely that the timings (that are measured in nanoseconds) will actually work&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;it would be portable to an Arduino with only small changes — due to needing accuracy to tens of nanoseconds, I was concerned that the fact that the Raspberry Pi does not have a real-time operating system may throw the timings out too far or be unreliable. An RTOS would allow my code to run with deterministic timings. So if it didn’t work on the Pi, I could try on an Arduino.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The packet values and pauses are all hardcoded into the program currently. If I was doing my day job, and following proper software engineering practices, this would be configurable, and there would be unit tests… but this is a home project hack, so I won’t bother with that for now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tried this on the Pi… and it failed. No click from the boiler relay 🙁&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To debug it, I set up my sniffer again. This time it would listen to the signals I was sending, rather than the original thermostat signals. Comparing my signals to the originals, I could see that they all seemed to be out a little: a little too long. Damned non real-time operating system! I can’t remember what the value was off the top of my head, but I recall it was in the region of 90ns. In true bodger style, I simply subtracted that from my values in the program and tried again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eureka!&lt;/strong&gt; It worked! The boiler clicked on as I issued the command:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-bash highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;sudo&lt;/span&gt; ./callforheat 1
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And off again with the command:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-bash highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;sudo&lt;/span&gt; ./callforheat 0
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;sudo&lt;/code&gt; was needed in order to access the pins via WiringPi — I believe this is no longer needed in the latest version of Raspbian at the time of writing)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I have a command that I can use, and write software around, to control my boiler. 🙂&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;update--30th-march-2016&quot;&gt;Update — 30th March 2016&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Github user &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/PatchworkBoy&quot; title=&quot;PatchworkBoy on Github&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;PatchworkBoy&lt;/a&gt; found when he sniffed the code for his set that the on/off signals are &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; the same, exactly, like mine appeared to be. For his units, he found that the on/off codes were slightly different in in the middle too (at the 10th bit):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-none&quot;&gt;    ON packet pair
    1 0001 1000 0100 1000 0000 0001 0000 0001
    1 1110 0111 1011 0111 1111 1110 1111 1110

    OFF packet pair
    1 0001 1000 1100 1000 0000 0001 0000 0000
    1 1110 0111 0011 0111 1111 1110 1111 1111
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, he found that the timings (the gaps between packets and pulses etc) were also different. Therefore, if you are following this blog post and attempting to decipher the code for your own units, you’ll probably have to read both the on/off codes and measure them fully, as it appears you may not be able to assume that these details will be the same as they were for me.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Ross</name></author><category term="433MHz" /><category term="audacity" /><category term="boiler" /><category term="control" /><category term="electronics" /><category term="heating" /><category term="Internet of Things" /><category term="IoT" /><category term="project" /><category term="radio" /><category term="raspberry pi" /><category term="RCR10/433" /><category term="siemens" /><category term="thermostat" /><summary type="html">This is a quick post in response to a question related to my boiler control Github project: https://github.com/rossharper/boilercontrol I intend to eventually perform a more comprehensive write-up of this whole project. Background I had been looking to start tinkering with my Raspberry Pi and do some home automation for a while. We have a Siemens RCR10/433 wireless thermostat programmer that controls our boiler and I wondered if it would be possible to hack the radio signal and take control of the boiler myself. Thus, I could create my own smart heating system inspired by products such as Nest and Hive.

&lt;p&gt;Easter weekend saw Liam and I head up to the Tweed Valley in Scotland for a couple of days mountain biking. Our base was the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.glentressforestlodges.co.uk/&quot; title=&quot;Glentress Forest Lodges&quot;&gt;campsite&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.7stanesmountainbiking.com/Glentress---Innerleithen&quot; title=&quot;Glentress on the 7 Stanes website&quot;&gt;Glentress Forest Park&lt;/a&gt;, where we camped with my tent and “the van”. It was to turn out to be a fantastically enjoyable weekend of trail-riding in glorious sunshine (the locals informed us we were very lucky to have such weather!). &lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;day-one&quot;&gt;Day One&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One We set off early on the Friday and arrived in Peebles at lunchtime. After spending a while driving around attempting to locate a supermarket, we gave in, swallowed our pride, and asked a local.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Ask that mum, Mums know where the supermarkets are!”&lt;/em&gt;, Liam told me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shortly afterward, we were in Sainsbury’s, stocking-up on essentials to add to the veritable selection of meat we had acquired from the Tebay Services’ Farm Shop. &lt;em&gt;“Officially the most picturesque services in the UK”&lt;/em&gt;, Liam asserts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we arrived at the campsite, we struck a deal with the owner to park our van and pitch our tent for £50 for the two nights. Not bad, we thought. The camp was made, the bikes were prepared, and we were promptly off for a lap of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.7stanesmountainbiking.com/Glentress---Innerleithen/The-Glentress-Red-Route&quot; title=&quot;Glentress Red Trail on the 7 Stanes website&quot;&gt;Glentress Red Trail&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.rossharper.net/img/wp-imports/2014/05/Photo-18-04-2014-12-04-22.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The &amp;quot;Lodges&amp;quot;&quot; title=&quot;The &amp;quot;Lodges&amp;quot;&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-503&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were both mightily impressed with Glentress, upon our first impression — helped, no doubt, by the summer-like sunshine drenching the valleys and blasting through the trees in the forest. The red trail (as well as the blue and the black) rose up a long but interesting climb from the visitors’ centre to the Buzzard’s Nest car park. There are some interesting little optional technical challenges and logs (“skinnies”) to try out on the way up. From Buzzard’s Nest, the trails split, and off we went for an exhilarating excursion along the 18km Red Route.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe height=&quot;405&quot; width=&quot;590&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowtransparency=&quot;true&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot; src=&quot;https://www.strava.com/activities/132323405/embed/098a8acdbfc25868bdcb4dd69d97561af44da812&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Upon returning from our first ride of the weekend, we headed straight into Peebles, the nearest village to Glentress. First order of the day was for me to buy some cycling glasses as I had forgotten mine. Leaving our bikes locked up at the bike shop, we then went on a wander through the village, stopping at the Green Tree Hotel for a couple of pints with the friendly locals. Following that, a stroll down to the River Tweed for an ice cream. Peebles really is a beautiful place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;centered&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rossharper.net/img/wp-imports/2014/05/Photo-18-04-2014-20-36-29.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.rossharper.net/img/wp-imports/2014/05/Photo-18-04-2014-20-36-29-300x300.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Peebles&quot; title=&quot;Peebles&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The evening was spent getting showered, barbecuing venison kebabs, beef burgers, sausages, collecting firewood, and getting a fire started to stay as warm as possible as the sun receded and the clear sky allowed the temperature to drop significantly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rossharper.net/img/wp-imports/2014/05/IMG_6064-2.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.rossharper.net/img/wp-imports/2014/05/IMG_6064.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Campfire&quot; title=&quot;Campfire&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-504&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Liam had given me the heads up before we left that the sky would be clear and that there was a pass-over expected from the International Space Station. So I packed my DSLR and tripod for the trip so that I could do some star trail photography.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, (as well as my glasses) I forgot my remote release — essential for executing long-exposure shots on continuous drive! Regardless, I set up and shot the fly by of ISS by holding my finger on the shutter for several minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It didn’t turn out great, but I captured the space station streaking across the sky nonetheless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rossharper.net/img/wp-imports/2014/05/IMG_6061-3.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.rossharper.net/img/wp-imports/2014/05/IMG_6061.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;ISS flyby&quot; title=&quot;ISS flyby&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-506&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;day-two&quot;&gt;Day Two&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After hitting the sack primarily to keep warm, I awoke in the middle of the night very cold indeed. When I finally arose as the sun started to come out, I discovered why the chill had become so noticeable… my tent had a layer of frost all over it! Breakfast scoffed and it was time to head off on the (overused word alert) &lt;em&gt;epic&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://7stanesmountainbiking.com/Glentress---Innerleithen/The-Glentress-Black-Route&quot; title=&quot;Glentress Black Route on the 7 Stanes website&quot;&gt;27km Black Route&lt;/a&gt;. There was plenty of climbing, but it was totally worth it for the views and the descents. Rocks, roots, berms, technical climbing, singletrack, gravel, mud — it had it all. Oh, and its outline looks like a dancing chicken.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe height=&quot;405&quot; width=&quot;590&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowtransparency=&quot;true&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot; src=&quot;https://www.strava.com/activities/132323398/embed/88a92b54db69f93aa53212aefce2768242a86177&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The black-graded trail begins with the same climb as the red trail that we had tackled the day before, but the black continues on further and ascends higher, to a point with a fantastic view of the surrounding area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rossharper.net/img/wp-imports/2014/05/Photo-19-04-2014-10-40-33.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.rossharper.net/img/wp-imports/2014/05/Photo-19-04-2014-10-40-331.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;View from Shieldgreen Kipps — almost the top of the Black Route&amp;quot; width=&amp;quot;677&amp;quot; height=&amp;quot;294&quot; title=&quot;View from Shieldgreen Kipps — almost the top of the Black Route&amp;quot; width=&amp;quot;677&amp;quot; height=&amp;quot;294&quot; class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-517&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the descending on the black route was simply spectacular and exhilarating. There were a few sketchy moments on loose rock and through bad line choices, but the adrenaline was well and truly pumping as we worked our way down well selected natural-feeling routes, zipping in and out of the forest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was even a section, some locals informed us as we began it, that was a &lt;em&gt;“real bike-breaker”&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;em&gt;“You’ll want to take a break about half-way through it, because your arms will be pumped and you’ll not enjoy the second half if your hanging on for dear life.”&lt;/em&gt;. We threw ourselves into it, sight obscured by vibration, the clangs and bangs echoing through aluminium tubing as we clattered our hardtails over terrain that would test the damping of even the most expensive full-bouncers. Catching up with the group we’d met at the start we agreed with their assessment of the trail’s trials; &lt;em&gt;“so this is the half-way rest point then?” “Och, nae! We rested way back there! We stopped again here ‘cos he’s got a puncture!”&lt;/em&gt;. Oh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Towards the bottom, the black route rejoins the red route for the final stages of what was a marvellous morning of mountain biking. The original plan was to have lunch and then see if we had it in us to head over to Innerleithen and attempt the red-graded trail there. However, with the heat, the climbing and the distance of the black trail we were pretty exhausted. After a filling lunch from the trailhead café, a relax at the camp, and based on a recommendation from a random couple, we decided to head out and do Glentress’ Blue Route in the afternoon. From the description we’d heard, it sounded like what it lacked in technicality, sketchiness and distance, it would make up for in smooth, flat-out, fun. We weren’t wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe height=&quot;405&quot; width=&quot;590&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowtransparency=&quot;true&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot; src=&quot;https://www.strava.com/activities/132323346/embed/762e894d8e338139f7c1c53bf0d259a80c645c2a&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s not the longest, and the first half wasn’t terribly interesting — certainly not as far as Liam was concerned (&lt;em&gt;“this can’t be a blue!”&lt;/em&gt;), although I enjoyed some of the technical climbing unique to this route — but beginning with a section called “Blue Velvet” (&lt;em&gt;“‘Blue Silk’, more like!”&lt;/em&gt;, based on how smooth it was), the descending was a blast for a rider willing to pedal hard, pump the trail, and boost the jumps. There was even a section that had “optional black features” — rock jumps and drop-offs to the side of the trail, that could be avoided by those taking it easy. Of course, being a “beginner trail”, one has to hammer it with caution along here, being ready to slow down or stop for those going slower or with small children. At one point I came flying off an “optional black feature” to discover, mid-air, a mother and small child stationary just beyond my landing area, distracted by the goings on above them in the Go-Ape course that crossed above the trail. Fortunately, slamming on the brakes upon landing, and them shuffling sideways, I passed-by safely. Something to be aware of!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That concluded a spectacular Saturday in the saddle. All that was needed to top-off the day was a shower and a taxi into Peebles for some beer and a hearty meal: Haggis, Neeps &amp;amp; Tatties — it’d be rude not to!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rossharper.net/img/wp-imports/2014/05/Photo-19-04-2014-20-52-13.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.rossharper.net/img/wp-imports/2014/05/Photo-19-04-2014-20-52-13-300x300.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Haggis, Neeps &amp;amp; Tatties&amp;quot; width=&amp;quot;300&amp;quot; height=&amp;quot;300&quot; title=&quot;Haggis, Neeps &amp;amp; Tatties&amp;quot; width=&amp;quot;300&amp;quot; height=&amp;quot;300&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter size-medium wp-image-521&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.rossharper.net/img/wp-imports/2013/01/DovestonePano04.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Alderman's Brow&quot; title=&quot;Alderman's Brow&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-476&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The walk was intended as a bit of training, in preparation for a future trip to the Isle of Arran. We took multi-day rucksacks packed with a bit of weight to make it a little harder. The route (below) was about 20km or so and — if I remember rightly — took us about 3h 45m (with a little, er, “detour” in the fog).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.rossharper.net/img/wp-imports/2013/01/Screen-Shot-2013-01-28-at-19.32.19.png&quot; alt=&quot;Dovestone Edge Route&quot; title=&quot;Dovestone Edge Route&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-477&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The snow — which was knee- (and even crotch-) deep in some places — made the going rather slow in places, but it was fun all the way. The route first took us up from the car park below Dovestone Reservoir to the War Memorial on Saddleworth Moor, passing some inquisitive sheep along the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.rossharper.net/img/wp-imports/2013/01/IMG_0546.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Dovestone Sheep&quot; title=&quot;Dovestone Sheep&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-479&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From there we visited Alderman’s Brow before descending back to the dam that holds back Yeoman Hey reservoir. After crossing the dam, we ascended alongside the Ashway Gap slipway up to Ashway Moss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.rossharper.net/img/wp-imports/2013/01/IMG_0579.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Ashway Gap Slipway&quot; title=&quot;Ashway Gap Slipway&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-483&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was during this ascent that the snow was at its deepest and most untouched. We followed the contour of Dovestone Edge, past the Great Dovestone Rocks, all the way to Chew Reservoir. From there we went across Wimberry Moss to Alphin Pike, before descending back to Oldham way and returning to the car and heading to the pub for some well-earned hot food and a pint.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Ross</name></author><category term="Alderman's Brow" /><category term="Alderman's Hill" /><category term="Dovestone Edge" /><category term="Hills" /><category term="Memorial" /><category term="Peak District" /><category term="Photography" /><category term="Reservoir" /><category term="Saddleworth Moor" /><category term="Snow" /><category term="Walking" /><category term="Winter" /><summary type="html">Dovestone and Yeoman Hey reservoirs taken from Dovestone Edge in the Peak District.

&lt;p&gt;Britain has seen its first covering of snow over the last few days, along with all the overreaction, complaining, and infrastructure meltdown that comes with even the lightest spinkling of water crystals this little island receives. Our nation seems ill-equipped to deal with the rare and irregular arrival of the white stuff, and handles its effects comedically poorly compared to some of our Scandinavian neighbours and Canadian cousins, who are well experienced in dealing with winter-long coatings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regardless, &lt;strong&gt;I &lt;em&gt;love&lt;/em&gt; the snow&lt;/strong&gt;. I’m always delighted by the transformation it makes to the landscape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had planned on going out for a walk in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peak_District&quot; title=&quot;Peak District Wikipedia Page&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Peak District&lt;/a&gt; today with a friend to enjoy our recent frosting, and maybe get a few photos along the way. Unfortunately, he couldn’t make it, I woke up with a hangover, and there had been no fresh snow, so I stayed at home — all terrible excuses, I know. So instead, here are some snow photos from the archive. The title image and the first three below were all taken around &lt;a href=&quot;https://maps.google.com/maps?hl=en&amp;#038;ll=53.64161,-2.254429&amp;#038;spn=0.017835,0.034676&quot; title=&quot;Scout Moor on Google Maps&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Scout Moor, near Ramsbottom&lt;/a&gt;, in December 2010.&lt;/p&gt;

They didn’t come out too great, possibly due to shooting through dirty glass. After this, those of us taking part in the fun run headed down to the start line and awaited The Queen, who started the race.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pinterest.com&quot; title=&quot;Pinterest website&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Pinterest&lt;/a&gt; seems to have taken off hugely recently and has become the social network du jour. I had a dabble with it when I first got an invite and “pinned” some of my own photos there and some other links I found interesting. However, it never really captivated me and I have largely ignored it since. While I, and many of my peers, may not have taken to this new way to share, others have. &lt;em&gt;Lots&lt;/em&gt; of others have. It seems to have become very popular amongst the female demographic in particular. I already had added support to share links to my blog posts via Twitter, Facebook, and Google+, so I decided to add a Pinterest “Pin-it” button too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.rossharper.net/img/wp-imports/2012/03/ShareBar.png&quot; alt=&quot;ShareBar&quot; title=&quot;ShareBar&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a relatively simple thing to do. &lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;plugin-vs-rolling-your-own&quot;&gt;Plugin vs. Rolling Your Own&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I should have called this &lt;em&gt;Adding a Pinterest Button to a WordPress Blog – The Quick &amp;amp; Dirty Way&lt;/em&gt;. When I first set up the blog, I knew I wanted to add sharing support. I briefly looked at a few off-the-shelf WordPress plugins, but none of them fitted what I wanted &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt;. So, I just baked my own sharing buttons into my custom WordPress theme. With hindsight, I should have developed this as a plugin, but I was new to WordPress at the time, so I didn’t bother. Putting this stuff into a configurable plugin is a todo task for the future. If you’d rather use a plugin, try &lt;a href=&quot;http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/search.php?q=pinterest&quot; title=&quot;Search for Pinterest Wordpress plugins&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;one of these&lt;/a&gt;. If you don’t like them, or, like me, prefer to roll your own, continue reading…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;my-existing-sharing-setup&quot;&gt;My Existing Sharing Setup&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly, I added a new PHP file to my theme that contains the code that generates the sharing buttons: &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;sharing.php&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I wanted to have the sharing buttons at the bottom of each post in the main view, and also at the bottom of the post on the single post view, I needed to add them to &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://codex.wordpress.org/The_Loop&quot; title=&quot;The WordPress Loop documentation&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;the loop&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For my theme, I have loop templates for the single and index pages (&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;loop-single.php&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;loop.php&lt;/code&gt;), within which I include the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;sharing.php&lt;/code&gt; script. I have a feature on my blog called the “postfeaturebox”, which sits below the main content of the post, so I added the sharing script here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script src=&quot;http://gist.github.com/2128034.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;sharing.php&lt;/code&gt; script contains the markup and PHP code for defining the sharing buttons:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script src=&quot;http://gist.github.com/2128334.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, these don’t all work on their own. In addition we need to add some scripts from the sites in question that load with our page, find the buttons, and perform some magic on them to make them active. These are added in my theme’s &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;functions.php&lt;/code&gt; script.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script src=&quot;http://gist.github.com/2128490.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, I’ve done some tweaking to the CSS classes for the buttons in order to position them the way I want:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script src=&quot;https://gist.github.com/rossharper/2128506.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;adding-the-pin-it-button&quot;&gt;Adding the Pin It Button&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adding the Pinterest “Pin it” button is much the same. As a starting point, I used the instructions on&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://pinterest.com/about/goodies/&quot; title=&quot;Pinterest Goodies page&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Pinterest’s Goodies page&lt;/a&gt; for adding a “Pin it” button. From there, I needed to customise the code so that each button was specific to the post in question; I needed to add: * The permalink URL for the post * The default description, which would be the post title * The URL for the featured image, to use as the pinned image Getting the permalink and title are straightforward, via calls to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;the_permalink()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;the_title()&lt;/code&gt;, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Getting the featured image is a little more complex, so I created a new function for it in my &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;functions.php&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script src=&quot;http://gist.github.com/2152690.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This checks if the post has an image via &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;has_post_thumbnail()&lt;/code&gt;. If it does, it retrieves it via &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;get_post_thumbnail_id( $post-&amp;gt;ID )&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;wp_get_attachment_image_src( $thumb_id, 'full', false );&lt;/code&gt;. The image src is returned as an array, so we get the actual URL from the array by getting the first item.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notice that I have chosen to get full-size images. You may wish to use a different size. Just in case the post does not have any images in it, the header image from the theme can be returned using a call to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;header_image()&lt;/code&gt;. Notice that I have commented this out because my current theme doesn’t use header images yet, the banner is hardcoded in my theme instead. If you have a hardcoded image you want to use, you can modify this code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, we can write the markup for the actual button itself, in &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;sharing.php&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script src=&quot;http://gist.github.com/2128610.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, we need to add a script in &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;functions.php&lt;/code&gt;. Here it is with the Pinterest script added:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script src=&quot;http://gist.github.com/2128718.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, do some CSS positioning:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script src=&quot;http://gist.github.com/2128738.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;!-- markdownlint-disable MD026 --&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;et-voila&quot;&gt;Et, Voila!&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That should be it. The posts should now include a Pinterest “Pin it” button along with the other sharing buttons. When I click on the button, it brings up Pinterest’s pinning dialog, with the appropriate details filled out from my post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.rossharper.net/img/wp-imports/2012/03/Pinning.png&quot; alt=&quot;Pinning&quot; title=&quot;Pinning&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some more handy resources:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://dev.twitter.com/docs/tweet-button&quot; title=&quot;Twitter Tweet Button at Twitter&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Twitter Tweet Button&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

I used it because I preferred it at the time. I plan on upgrading this to use Facebook’s latest sharing tools.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.com/webmasters/+1/button/&quot; title=&quot;Google +1 Button at Google&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Google+ +1 Button&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;For Facebook sharing, I am also using the &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.ashfame.com/2011/02/wordpress-plugin-fix-facebook-like-thumbnail/&quot; title=&quot;Facebook Like Thumbnail plugin by Ashish Saini&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Facebook Like Thumbnail plugin&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.ashfame.com/&quot; title=&quot;Ashish Saini's blog&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Ashish Saini&lt;/a&gt;, which helps by using the featured image of the post for Facebook sharing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;update&quot;&gt;UPDATE&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may have noticed that I have since removed the Facebook and Google+ sharing buttons. My main reason for this was because the formatting had gone wrong on them, but also for performance reasons — there are just to many scripts running on each page. I’ll probably remove Pinterest soon and just leave Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Ross</name></author><category term="+1" /><category term="blog" /><category term="Blogging" /><category term="Button" /><category term="CSS" /><category term="Facebook" /><category term="Google+" /><category term="HTML" /><category term="PHP" /><category term="Pin It" /><category term="Pinterest" /><category term="Programming" /><category term="Sharing" /><category term="Social" /><category term="Technology" /><category term="theme" /><category term="Twitter" /><category term="Web" /><category term="Website" /><category term="wordpress" /><summary type="html">Pinterest seems to have taken off hugely recently and has become the social network du jour. I had a dabble with it when I first got an invite and “pinned” some of my own photos there and some other links I found interesting. However, it never really captivated me and I have largely ignored it since. While I, and many of my peers, may not have taken to this new way to share, others have. Lots of others have. It seems to have become very popular amongst the female demographic in particular. I already had added support to share links to my blog posts via Twitter, Facebook, and Google+, so I decided to add a Pinterest “Pin-it” button too. It’s a relatively simple thing to do.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://www.rossharper.net/img/wp-imports/2012/03/Pinterest_Logo.png" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://www.rossharper.net/img/wp-imports/2012/03/Pinterest_Logo.png" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Rewind: Amsterdam</title><link href="https://www.rossharper.net/2012/03/rewind-amsterdam/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Rewind: Amsterdam" /><published>2012-03-19T18:25:19+00:00</published><updated>2012-03-19T18:25:19+00:00</updated><id>https://www.rossharper.net/2012/03/rewind-amsterdam</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://www.rossharper.net/2012/03/rewind-amsterdam/">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/ross_harper/6744369247&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.rossharper.net/img/wp-imports/2012/03/IMG_9652.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Amsterdam at Night&quot; title=&quot;Amsterdam at Night&quot; class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-313&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got the chance to go to &lt;a href=&quot;http://wikitravel.org/en/Amsterdam&quot; title=&quot;Wikitravel guide to Amsterdam&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Amsterdam&lt;/a&gt; for a couple of weeks back at the end of October last year. I’d been a few years before for a weekend, but I wasn’t really into photography back then and had other distractions. This time, the trip was for business, to do some work on-site with a supplier, and I had a spare weekend to get out and take some photographs of the city.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/ross_harper/6997207157&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.rossharper.net/img/wp-imports/2012/03/IMG_9689.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A chess game being played at the NEMO museum&quot; title=&quot;A chess game being played at the NEMO museum&quot; class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-314&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the first things I always notice when I first arrive in Amsterdam is just how many bicycles there are. They are everywhere! Pretty much everyone gets around on a bike and locks them up (or not) wherever they are shopping/eating/drinking. There are often hundreds of bikes tied to the railings along roads, or bunched up in designated cycle bays. I really don’t know how people find their own bike again when they return, there are so many. It’s also noticeable that bicycles appear to right of way. &lt;em&gt;Everywhere. All the time.&lt;/em&gt; Even if you are a pedestrian on a crossing, and the little green man is on, indicating that you can proceed, bicycles still stream through the junction and you will be cursed over the aggressive ringing of a bell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout the week, I was making the most of the time with the supplier, so it was quite late by the time I’d returned to the hotel to dump my laptop etc. After that I only really had time to go out and find something to eat — often in one of the city’s many Irish pubs due to restrictions on expenses, but I did get out to try some &lt;a href=&quot;http://wikitravel.org/en/Amsterdam#Eat&quot; title=&quot;Amsterdam &amp;quot;Eat&amp;quot; guide at Wikitravel&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;highly recommended&lt;/a&gt; Indonesian food.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the weekend I went for a wander around the city, visiting some of the tourist attractions and taking a few photos. Unfortunately, the weather wasn’t great for most of the weekend. It was overcast, dull, and grey for most of the day that I was walking around. Ironically, as soon as I retired to the hotel to rest my weary legs and prepare to go out for the evening, the clouds lifted and the city was drenched in beautiful golden hour sunshine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the attractions I visited was the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rijksmuseum.nl/&quot; title=&quot;Rijksmuseum website&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Rijksmuseum&lt;/a&gt;. This was a bit of an anticlimax, as most of it is closed for refurbishment, and only a small wing is left open. I’m not sure the €12 entry fee was all that worth it for me — unless you are really into paintings, particularly portraits. I guess I am spoiled by museums and gallerys in the UK generally being free. There were some interesting things to see there, however, such as some stunning &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rembrandt&quot; title=&quot;Rembrandt article on Wikipedia&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Rembrandts&lt;/a&gt; — including the massive and amazing &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Night_Watch_(painting)&quot; title=&quot;Night Watch article on Wikipedia&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Night Watch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After walking down to the Rijksmuseum from my hotel (the &lt;a href=&quot;http://maps.google.com/maps?q=NH+Doelen&amp;#038;fb=1&amp;#038;hq=NH+Doelen&amp;#038;hnear=NH+Doelen&amp;#038;cid=0,0,10958826321503816274&amp;#038;t=h&amp;#038;z=16&amp;#038;iwloc=A&quot; title=&quot;NH Dolen on Google Maps&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;NH Dolen&lt;/a&gt; in Centrum), I took a meandering wander back up via the city’s canals to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.e-nemo.nl/&quot; title=&quot;NEMO museum website&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;NEMO museum of Science&lt;/a&gt;. It’s an interesting looking building, like a sinking ship’s bow poking out of the ocean. From the “deck” there are some great views over the main harbours of Amsterdam centrum and over to Amsterdam Centraal, as well as a giant chess set to keep bored dads entertained. Inside it was a vast space of interactive exhibitions that I think would be excellent for children — who said Amsterdam wasn’t family friendly?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.rossharper.net/img/wp-imports/2012/03/IMG_9670.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;NEMO Museum&quot; title=&quot;NEMO Museum&quot; class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-329&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a flying visit to the museum, I wandered back to Centrum, then down some of the main shopping streets to &lt;a href=&quot;http://maps.google.com/maps?q=dam+square&amp;#038;fb=1&amp;#038;hq=dam+square&amp;#038;cid=0,0,1715436202454407483&amp;#038;t=h&amp;#038;z=16&amp;#038;iwloc=A&quot; title=&quot;Dam Square on Google Maps&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Dam Square&lt;/a&gt;. Then, I retired to the hotel, and prepared for an evening of excellent improv comedy at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.boomchicago.nl/&quot; title=&quot;Boom Chicago website&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Boom Chicago&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.com/maps?q=leidseplein+12+amsterdam&amp;#038;hl=en&amp;#038;sll=52.361098,4.897001&amp;#038;sspn=0.018267,0.038495&amp;#038;hnear=Leidseplein+12,+De+Weteringschans,+Amsterdam,+Noord-Holland,+The+Netherlands&amp;#038;view=map&amp;#038;t=h&amp;#038;z=16&amp;#038;iwloc=A&quot; title=&quot;Leidseplein on Google Maps&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Leidseplein&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, it was a nice trip, although I did get somewhat bored of eating out on my own. Hopefully next time I can return with friends to relax and enjoy the place a bit more.&lt;/p&gt;
